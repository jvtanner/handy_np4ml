Adapted from Stanford CS230 assignment. 

Material covers:

1) Sigmoid functions (basic and for arrays), sigmoid derivative.
2) Image to vector.
3) Normalization function (divide by Euclidean dist) for vector rows.
4) Softmax function.
5) Vectorization speed reference file. Comparison of runtimes 
    for various approaches.
6) Two loss functions
